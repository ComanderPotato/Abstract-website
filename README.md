# Abstract website project
A frontend project I did found on [Frontendpractice.com](https://www.frontendpractice.com/) to practice. Based off the [Abstract]([https://canalstreet.market/](https://help.abstract.com/hc/en-us)) website listed.

## Finished product
Here you can find the finish [project](https://roaring-cranachan-f150d5.netlify.app/). The HTML is simple, using semantic HTML5 markup and the BEM naming convetion to make it clean and readable.
